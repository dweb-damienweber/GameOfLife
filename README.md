# GameOfLife

John Horton Conway died a couple of days ago (11 April 2020) so I wanted to take a couple of minutes to make a little Game of Life.

## Rules (Wikipedia)

-Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
-Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
-Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
-Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
